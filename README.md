In this project, we have created an application in which clients can post the jobs depending on their location. While posting any job, individual must mention the “Job Tittle”, “Job Description”, “Category”, “Province”, “City”. Before posting the job, one have to make sure that he has been registered and after that one have to login his account and start the process. There are three options in the navigation bar “Home”, “Post”, “About”. A client can post the jobs by selecting and filling the required fields from the post option in the navigation bar. We have added some more features for our clients, if client wants to edit or remove the job posted, then he can do it by simply pressing edit or delete button. There is also a customize message box at the bottom of the web application. If user need any kind of help then he can directly send message  or leave the message.

For the job seekers, we have also added some features like, if the individual is looking for particular type of job, then he can easily go to home page and click on the button more info under each service. For example, if individual is looking for tutor, then he can click the “more info” option under the service “Tutor” and can see the posting there.
We have also made sure that only the user with username and password can login and see the information. Users without username and password are unable to see and post jobs. If the user directly enter the URL of page the page he wants to look into then it will redirect to login page.

We have also used JSP files, servlets, bootstrap, CSS, html files and images to make project attractive.
